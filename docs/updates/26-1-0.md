This update lays down a **new foundational direction** for how Bedrock Perfected will be developed and maintained going forward.

## Add-on Description Migration

Previously, Bedrock Perfected’s add-on description was provided directly on third-party marketplaces such as MCPEDL and CurseForge.

Starting with this update, **all detailed descriptions have been fully moved to this wiki**.

Due to the extensive number of systems and features included in Bedrock Perfected, maintaining full descriptions on marketplace pages proved inefficient, cluttered, and in some cases slow to load. This wiki-based approach allows for:

* Better organization of features
* More detailed explanations
* Faster updates and revisions

Marketplace pages will now provide only a brief overview and a link to this wiki for complete documentation.



## New Update Cycle

Starting with this update, Bedrock Perfected will follow a **monthly release cycle**, with updates planned to release on the **1st of each month**.

This means players can expect:

* **12 major updates per year**
* Predictable and consistent release timing

### Hotfix Policy

Hotfixes may be released **only when critical bugs or severe issues are discovered after release**.
Hotfixes:

* Do **not** count as a monthly update
* Are intended to address urgent issues only

This approach prioritizes stronger quality control before each monthly release.



## New Version Numbering System

Starting with this update, Bedrock Perfected adopts a **date-based versioning format**:

```
[Release Year].[Release Month].[Hotfix]
```

### Example

For this release:

```
26.1
```

* `26` → Year 2026
* `1` → January

The hotfix number is **optional** and will only be appended when necessary (e.g. `26.1.1`).
Main monthly releases will **not** include a `.0` suffix.

This system keeps versioning simple, readable, and directly tied to the release schedule.
