# Bedrock Perfected 26.1
::: info
This update was released on January 1, 2026.
:::

This update is changing and laying a whole new fundamentals on how Bedrock Perfected will be build around in the future.

## Moving Addon Description
Previously, addon description are provided directly on the marketplace itself like MCPEDL and CurseForge.

Starting this update, all description is removed altogether from those marketplace and moved into this wiki because the extensive amount of features this addon provides makes descripting in those marketplace became very inefficient and slow to load.

I'm hoping by moving into this format of addon description will resulting in a better experience.

## New Updates Cycle
Starthing this update, Bedrock Perfected is expected to receive a monthly update every the 1st date of the month. Players can expect a twelve updates a year.

Hotfixes will be shipped if found critical bugs or problem later after release and won't count as the monthly update quota.

## New Version Numbering System
Starting this update, Bedrock Perfected will be releasing updates with this version numbering format:

```
[Release Year].[Release Month].[Hotfixes]
```

As example in this update, the version would be:
```
26.1
```

The use of hotfixes is optional and possibly least expected to maintain the quality shipped with the addon forcing extensive quality control before releasing it.
